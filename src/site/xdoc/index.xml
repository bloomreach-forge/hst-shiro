      <subsection name="What is HST - Apache Shiro Integration Support?">
        <p>
          <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Shiro</a>
          is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management.
        </p>
        <p>
          HST - Apache Shiro Integration Support project provides seamless integration with Apache Shiro for HST-2 SITE applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainly, HST - Apache Shiro Integration Support project provides the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="hipporepo-realm.html">Hippo Repository based Realm component</a> providing authentication/authorization against Hippo Repository security data store.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because Apache Shiro provides a lot of out-of-box security integration solutions such as RDBMS,
          LDAP and CAS authentication, you can take advantage of those with HST-2!
